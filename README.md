# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
Seth and Tom have been assigned with an election audit by the election commission and our task for this project was to assist them write a python code to calculate some numbers. 
We originally helped them calculate;
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

As part of our final audit the election commission requested some additional data as below;
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

Our election results was provided to us in a csv file with 369,712 records and python is a great tool for reading such large files so we used our python skills to write Seth and Tom a code that could do all the above calculations with a click of a button and output it on to a text file to be delivered to the commission.
